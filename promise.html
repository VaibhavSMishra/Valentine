      Garima,<br><br>
      There are too many promises I want to make for you —  
      yeh aap par depend karta hai aap mere se kya chahte ho.<br><br>

      Today is Promise Day.  
      If you want any promise from me, you can ask —  
      I will never say no, if it is possible from my side.<br><br>

      If you think I am worthy of you,  
      and you are forever mine,  
      then I will sacrifice everything for you.<br><br>

      As a true friend, I promise that whenever you need me —  
      in good days or bad days —  
      I will always stand beside you in every situation.<br><br>

      If the whole world stands against you,  
      I will forever stand with you,  
      no matter what terms and conditions arise.<br><br>

      I promise you that I am not like others who make use of others my only intension is to be with you forever and whenever you feel low i'm there for you.<br>
      In return if you think i am fit for you then i want to spend my life with you.<br><br>

      Main perfect hone ka wada nahi karta, par itna zaroor hai—tumhari izzat, tumhara bharosa, aur tumhara saath… hamesha dil se nibhaunga. 🤍✨
      and Ek promise mai bhi aapse chahunga kya aap karoge?
