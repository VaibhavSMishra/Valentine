      Garima,<br><br>
      There are too many promises I want to make for you —  
      yeh aap par depend karta hai aap mere se kya chahte ho.<br><br>

      Today is Promise Day.  
      If you want any promise from me, you can ask —  
      I will never say no, if it is possible from my side.<br><br>

      If you think I am worthy of you,  
      and you are forever mine,  
      then I will sacrifice everything for you.<br><br>

      As a true friend, I promise that whenever you need me —  
      in good days or bad days —  
      I will always stand beside you in every situation.<br><br>

      If the whole world stands against you,  
      I will forever stand with you,  
      no matter what terms and conditions arise.<br><br>

      I promise you that I am not like others who make use of others my only intension is to be with you forever and whenever you feel low i'm there for you.<br>
      In return if you think i am fit for you then i want to spend my life with you.<br><br>

      These are the things what i think from my heart and now its upto you how you think about me whethether I am able to you or not.<br>
      See, One more thing I am not forcing you to chose me basically its your choice but chose only that person who is capable cause i know if you are not happy or in trouble it will not be acceptable mai nahi dekh paunga.<br>
      mana mai accha nahi hun perfect nahi hun but don't call me Sahil Jha mai vaisa nahi hun time doge aap khud samjhoge, mere par agar bharosa karoge to khud samjhoge if some one is very close to me I can go any stage to help and support that person and
      you are very close to my heart for that I can sacrifice any thing, please don't think these thing for me again🙏😔.
      And I say you have a right to judge me and also tell me where I am wrong so that i correct it and make me perfect as per you
      from now I am going to accept wherever I am incorrect and only listen to you rather then explaining myself.<br><br> 
      
      Main perfect hone ka wada nahi karta, par itna zaroor hai—tumhari izzat, tumhara bharosa, aur tumhara saath… hamesha dil se nibhaunga. 🤍✨
      and Ek promise mai bhi aapse chahunga kya aap karoge?
