  Garima, this rose is for you — because you make my world bloom ❤️
</p>
<p>I Know you, you love flowers mainly roses cause you yourself like a rose 😊 or garden of flowers. your presence is like flowers blooming 
    in Sunny day.<br>
    You are like a My Sun cause i wait like a Sunflower when sun rises I start watching towards you until Sun sets.<br>
    I don't know whether i am fit or not but I want to become a thorn of My beloved rose 😊<br>

    I wish you get someone who really cares for you and keep you like a rose, gently, calmly and listen to you.<br> 

    I know there are too many peoples are like me and everyone wants to be your friend cause you are perfect and your aura i think attract each and 
    every person whoever interacted with you but be aware of garderners who just use roses for there personal use.<br>
    I just wanna say that chose only those one who really care and you have to find and real and geniune one who care and respect you entire life and keep you like a rose and aap hamesha rose ki tarah fresh and happy raho.
